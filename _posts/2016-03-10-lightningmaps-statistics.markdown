There is a lightning detection system. Detailed information you can find at 

[www.blitzortung.org](http://www.blitzortung.org){:target="_blank"}

I own such a system too and therefore I am also part of this network.

My setup consists of an E-field antenna and a H-field antenna. 

Living in a city I didn't expect results over the average. But surprised I am very often in the top range. 

Here you can see the stroke ratio of my station "Wien Mauer JN88DD45at"

Most of the time I am in the top 10. But sometime my station is detecting most strokes of all stations.
