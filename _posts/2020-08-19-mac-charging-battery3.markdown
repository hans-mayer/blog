[See here the techinal details for my MacBook.](/2016/06/26/MacBookPro.html){:target="_blank"}

This is already my third battery. The second one was just one year old when it died. But it was replaced on guarantee.

[See here the charging curve from my first battery.](/2016/07/27/mac-charging-battery.html){:target="_blank"}

For a full loaded battery "istats battery" reports now:

Very interesting is the temperature of the battery over time.
